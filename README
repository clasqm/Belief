Belief

CLI utility to generate random religious creeds  A bit like fortune

This utility was originally written for the Be Operating system, but since C is quite portable, it should compile anywhere.

No distinct licensing information was found. This comes from a kinder, gentler age, before we all became obsessed with licenses. I will regard it as Public Domain until the original author tells me otherwise.

I have updated the built-in tables a bit - some of the references were sooo 90's.
