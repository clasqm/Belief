# Belief
**by Brad Templeton**

A CLI utility to generate random religious creeds. A bit like fortune.

This utility was originally found in a version for the Be Operating system, but since C is quite portable, it should compile anywhere.

No distinct licensing information was found. This comes from a kinder, gentler age, before we all became obsessed with licenses. I will regard it as Public Domain until the original author tells me otherwise.

I have updated the built-in data tables a bit - some of the references were sooo 90's.

Compiled and packaged for:
+ [Haiku x86](./belief-1.1-1-x86_gcc2.hpkg)
+ [Haiku x86_64](belief_64-1.0-2-x86_64.hpkg)
+ [FreeDOS](https://clasqm.github.io/freedos-repo/zip/belief.zip)
