<h1>Belief</h1>

<p><strong>by Unknown</strong></p>

<p>A CLI utility to generate random religious creeds. A bit like fortune.</p>

<p>This utility was originally found in a version for the Be Operating system, but since C is quite portable, it should compile anywhere.</p>

<p>No distinct licensing information was found. This comes from a kinder, gentler age, before we all became obsessed with licenses. I will regard it as Public Domain until the original author tells me otherwise. There is a reference to Brad Templeton in the code, but he does not recognise it as his own.</p>

<p>I have updated the built-in data tables a bit - some of the references were sooo 90's.</p>

<p>Compiled and packaged for:</p>

<ul>
